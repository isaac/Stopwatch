# Ruby Cocoa Graphics is a graphics library providing a simple object-oriented 
# interface into the power of Mac OS X's Core Graphics and Core Image drawing libraries.  
# With a few lines of easy-to-read code, you can write scripts to draw simple or complex 
# shapes, lines, and patterns, process and filter images, create abstract art or visualize 
# scientific data, and much more.
# 
# Inspiration for this project was derived from Processing and NodeBox.  These excellent 
# graphics programming environments are more full-featured than RCG, but they are implemented 
# in Java and Python, respectively.  RCG was created to offer similar functionality using 
# the Ruby programming language.
