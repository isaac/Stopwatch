## Quick Overview
It's quiet simple.  NSXMLDocument and NSXMLElement each have a new method: toDictionary.
  [myXMLDoc toDictionary]; //Returns a dictionary representation of the xml document.
  // See AIXMLElementSerialize.h for more info

## Using the Framework on OS X
Add an existing framework and select the AIXMLSerialization.framework. Then include the 
header:
    #import <AIXMLSerialization/AIXMLSerialization.h>


## Using on the iPhone
Copy over the files in the 'src' and 'vendor/kissxml' directories to your project.
In the build settings set "Other linker flags" to -lxml2
In the build settings set "Header search paths" to /usr/include/libxml2

    #import "AIXMLSerialization.h"

The KissXML library is mapped to it's NSXML counterparts (e.g. NSXMLDocument points to DDXMLDocument) 
and it's recommended that you use the NSXML prefix.



## GOALS
* Work on the iPhone and OS X.  On the iPhone we can replace NSXML* with DDXML* from
  KissXML (http://code.google.com/p/kissxml/) which aims to be a direct replacement for 
  NSXML on the iPhone.  

## TODO
* Type checking and conversion
* NSDictionary to XML

## Running the benchmark
WARNING: committees.xml is 257kb and is parsed over 2500 times so it will take a 
while.
Simply build the foundation tool (command+B) and run:
    ./benchmark -f FILE_TO_PARSE -p yes
    // -f (REQUIRED) - File to parse
    // -p (OPTIONAL) - Print output

## Running Unit Tests
1. Build unittests bundle (command+b)
2. Set otest as active executable
3. command+alt+y (Run->Debug)
